<p class="second-heading">The Clock that Had
no Hands</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Newspaper</span> advertising is to business,
what hands are to a clock. It
is a direct and <em>certain</em> means of
letting the public know <em>what you are doing</em>.
In these days of intense and vigilant commercial
contest, a dealer who does not advertise
is like <em>a clock that has no hands</em>. He
has no way of recording his movements. He
can no more expect a twentieth century
success with nineteenth century methods,
than he can wear the same sized shoes as
a <em>man</em>, which fitted him in his <em>boyhood</em>.</p>

<p>His father and mother were content with
neighborhood shops and bobtail cars; nothing
better could be had in their day. They
were accustomed to <em>seek</em> the merchant instead
of being sought <em>by</em> him. They dealt
&ldquo;around the corner&rdquo; in one-story shops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>which depended upon the <em>immediate friends</em>
of the dealer for support. So long as the
city was made up of such neighborhood
units, each with a full outfit of butchers,
bakers, clothiers, jewelers, furniture dealers
and shoemakers, it was possible for the
proprietors of these little establishments
to exist and make a profit.</p>

<p>But as population increased, transit facilities
spread, sections became specialized,
block after block was entirely devoted to
stores, and mile after mile became solely
occupied by homes.</p>

<p>The purchaser and the storekeeper <em>grew
farther and farther apart</em>. It was <em>necessary</em>
for the merchant to find a <em>substitute</em> for
his direct personality, which <em>no longer served</em>
to draw customers to his door. <em>He had to
have a bond between the commercial center
and the home center.</em> Rapid transit eliminated
distance but advertising was necessary
to inform people <em>where</em> he was located and
<em>what he had to sell</em>. It was a natural outgrowth
of changed conditions&mdash;the beginning
of <em>a new era</em> in trade which no longer
relied upon personal acquaintance for success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5&ndash;6</a></span>
Something more wonderful than the
fabled philosopher's stone came into being,
and the beginnings of <em>fortunes which would
pass the hundred million mark and place
tradesmen's daughters</em> upon <em>Oriental thrones</em>
grew from this new force. Within fifty
years it has become as vital to industry as
<em>steam</em> to <em>commerce</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising is <em>not</em> a <em>luxury</em> nor a <em>debatable
policy</em>. <em>It has proven its case.</em> Its record
is traced in the skylines of cities where a
hundred towering buildings stand as a
lesson of reproach to the men who had the
<em>opportunity</em> but <em>not</em> the <em>foresight</em>, and furnish
a constant inspiration to the <em>young merchant</em>
at the <em>threshold</em> of his career.</p>

<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span></div>
<p class="second-heading">The Cannon that
Modernized Japan</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Business</span> is no longer a man to man
contact, in which the seller and the
buyer establish a <em>personal</em> bond, any
more than battle is a hand-to-hand grapple
wherein bone and muscle and sinew decide
the outcome. <em>Trade</em> as well as <em>war</em> has
changed aspect&mdash;<em>both are now fought at long
range</em>.</p>

<p>Just as a present day army of heroes
would have no opportunity to display the
<em>individual</em> valor of its members, just so
a merchant who counts upon his direct
acquaintanceship for success, is a relic of
the past&mdash;<em>a business dodo</em>.</p>

<p>Japan changed her policy of exclusion to
foreigners, after a fleet of warships battered
down the Satsuma fortifications. The
Samurai, who had hitherto considered their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>blades and bows efficient, discovered that
one cannon was mightier than all the swords
in creation&mdash;<em>if they could not get near enough
to use them</em>. Japan profited by the lesson.
She did not wait until <em>further</em> ramparts were
pounded to pieces but was satisfied with her
<em>one</em> experience and proceeded to modernize
her methods.</p>

<p>The merchant who doesn't advertise is
pretty much in the same position as that
in which Japan stood when her eyes were
opened to the fact that <em>times had changed</em>.
The long range publicity of a competitor
will as surely destroy his business as the
cannon of the foreigners crumbled the walls
of Satsuma. Unless you take the lesson to
heart, unless you <em>realize</em> the importance of
advertising, not only as a means of <em>extending</em>
your business but for <em>defending</em> it as
well, you must be prepared to face the consequences
of a folly as great as that of a
duelist who expects to survive in a contest
in which his <em>adversary</em> bears a <em>sword twice
the length of his own</em>.</p>

<p>Don't think that it's <em>too late</em> to begin because
there are so many stores which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>had the advantage of years of cumulative
advertising. The city is growing. It will
grow even more next year. It needs <em>increased
trading facilities</em> just as it's hungry
for new neighborhoods.</p>

<p><em>But it will never again support neighborhood
stores.</em> Newspaper advertising has
reduced the value of being <em>locally prominent</em>,
and five cent street car fares have
cut out the advantage of being &ldquo;<em>around
the corner</em>.&rdquo; A store five miles away, can
reach out through the columns of the daily
newspaper and draw your next door neighbor
to its aisles, while you sit by and see the
people on your own block enticed away,
without your being able to retaliate or
secure <em>new</em> customers to take their place.</p>

<p>It is not a question of your ability to
<em>stand the cost</em> of advertising but of being
able to <em>survive without it</em>. The thing you
have to consider is not only an <em>extension</em>
of your business but of holding <em>what you
already have</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising is an <em>investment</em>, the cost of
which is in the same proportion to its <em>returns</em>
as <em>seeds</em> are to the <em>harvest</em>. And it is just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>preposterous for you to consider publicity
as an expense, as it would be for a farmer
to hesitate over purchasing a <em>fertilizer</em>, if he
discovered that he could <em>profitably increase</em>
his crops by <em>employing</em> it.</p>

<p class="second-heading">The Tailor who Paid

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">I was</span> buying a cigar last week when a
man dropped into the shop and after
making a purchase told the proprietor
that he had started a clothes shop around
the corner and quoted him prices, with the
assurance of best garments and terms.</p>

<p>After he left the cigar man turned to me
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enterprising fellow, that, he'll get
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he <em>won't</em>,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and, furthermore,
I'll wager you that he hasn't the sort
of clothes shop that will <em>enable</em> him to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you think that?&rdquo; queried
the man behind the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His theories are wrong,&rdquo; I explained;
&ldquo;he's relying upon word of mouth publicity
to build up his business and he can't <em>interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>enough individuals</em> to compete with a
merchant, who has sense enough to say the
<em>same</em> things he told you, to a <em>hundred
thousand</em> men, while he is telling it to <em>one</em>.
Besides, his method of advertising is <em>too expensive</em>.
Suppose he sees a <em>hundred</em> persons
every day. First of all, he is robbing his
business of its necessary direction and besides,
he is spending too much to reach every
man he solicits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't quite follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as the proprietor of a clothes shop
his own time is so valuable that I am very
conservative in my estimate when I put
the cost of his soliciting at five cents a head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if he were <em>really</em> able and clever
he would discover that he can talk to hundreds
of thousands of people at a tenth of
a cent per individual. There is not a newspaper
in town the advertising rate of which
is $1.00 per thousand circulation, for a space
big enough in which to <em>display what he said
to you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never looked at it <em>that</em> way,&rdquo; said the
cigar man.</p>

<p>It's only &ldquo;<em>the man who hasn't looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17&ndash;18</a></span>it that way</em>,&rdquo; who hesitates for an instant
over the advisability and profitableness of
newspaper publicity.</p>

<p>Newspaper advertising is the cheapest
channel of communication ever established
by man. A thousand letters with one-cent
stamps, will easily cost fifteen dollars and
not one envelope in ten will be opened because
<em>the very postage</em> is an invitation to the
wastebasket.</p>

<p>If there were anything <em>cheaper</em> rest assured
that the greatest merchants in
America would not spend individual sums
ranging up to <em>half a million dollars a year
and over</em>, upon this form of attracting trade.</p>

<p class="second-heading">The Man who
Retreats before His
Defeat</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Advertising</span> <em>isn't</em> magic. There
is no element of the black art about
it. In its best and highest form it
is <em>plain</em> talk, <em>sane</em> talk&mdash;<em>selling</em> talk. Its
results are in proportion to the <em>merit</em> of the
subject advertised and the <em>ability</em> with
which the advertising is done.</p>

<p>There are two great obstacles to advertising
profit, and both of them arise from
ignorance of the <em>real</em> functions and workings
of publicity.</p>

<p>The first is to advertise <em>promises</em> which
will not be <em>fulfilled</em>,&mdash;because all that advertising
can do when it <em>accomplishes most</em>,
is to influence the reader to <em>investigate</em> your
claims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22">22</a></span>
<em>If you promise the earth and deliver the
moon, advertising will not pay you.</em></p>

<p>If you bring men and women to your
store on <em>pretense</em> and fail to <em>make good</em>,
advertising will have <em>harmed</em> you, because
it has only drawn attention to the fact that
you are to be <em>avoided</em>.</p>

<p>It is as <em>unjust</em> to charge advertising with
<em>failure</em> under these conditions, as it would be
for your <em>neighbor</em> to rob a bank and make
you responsible for <em>his</em> misdeed. In brief,
<em>advertised</em> dishonesty is <em>even more profitless</em>
than <em>unexploited</em> deception.</p>

<p>The other great error in advertising is to
expect more <em>out</em> of advertising than there
is <em>in</em> it.</p>

<p><em>Advertising is seed which a merchant plants
in the confidence of the community.</em> He must
allow time for it to <em>grow</em>. Every successful
advertiser has to be <em>patient</em>. The time that
it takes to arrive at results rests entirely
with the ability and determination devoted
to the work. But you cannot turn
back when you have traveled half way and
declare that the <em>path</em> is wrong.</p>

<p>You can't advertise for a <em>week</em>, and because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23">23</a></span>your store isn't crowded, say it hasn't
<em>paid</em> you. It takes a certain period to
attract the attention of readers. Everybody
doesn't see what you print the <em>first</em> time it
appears. More will notice your copy the
<em>second day</em>, <em>a great many more</em> at the end
of a month.</p>

<p>You cannot expect to win the confidence
of the community to the same degree that
other men have obtained it, without taking
pretty much the same length of time that
<em>they</em> did. But you <em>can</em> cut short the period
between your introduction to your reader
and his introduction to your <em>counters</em>, by
spending <em>more</em> effort in preparing your

convincingness.</p>

<p>You mustn't act like the little girl who
sowed a garden and came out the <em>next
day</em> expecting to find it in <em>full bloom</em>. Her
father had to explain to her that plants
require <em>roots</em> and that, although she could
not <em>see</em> what was going on, <em>the seeds were
doing their most important work just before
the flowers showed above ground</em>.</p>

<p>So <em>advertising is</em> doing its most <em>important</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24">24</a></span>work before the big results eventuate, and
to abandon the money which has been
invested just before results arrive, is not
only foolish but childish. <em>It would be just
as logical for a farmer to desert his fields
because he cannot harvest his corn a week
after he planted it.</em></p>

<p>Advertising does not require <em>faith</em>&mdash;merely
<em>common sense</em>. If it is begun in
doubt and relinquished before normal results
can be <em>reasonably</em> looked for, the fault
does not lie with the newspaper nor with
publicity&mdash;the blame is solely on the head
of the coward who <em>retreated before he was
defeated</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Every</span> dollar spent in advertising is
not only a <em>seed</em> dollar which <em>produces
a profit</em> for the merchant, but is actually
<em>retained</em> by him even <em>after he has
paid it to the publisher</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising creates <em>a good will</em> equal to
the cost of the publicity.</p>

<p>Advertising <em>really costs nothing</em>. While it
<em>uses</em> funds it does not <em>use them up</em>. It helps
the founder of a business to grow rich and
then <em>keeps</em> his business alive after his death.</p>

<p><em>It eliminates the personal equation.</em> It
perpetuates confidence <em>in the store</em> and makes
it possible for a merchant <em>to withdraw</em> from
<em>business</em> without having the <em>profits</em> of the
business <em>withdrawn</em> from <em>him</em>. It changes
a <em>name</em> to an <em>institution</em>&mdash;an institution
which will <em>survive</em> its builder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28">28</a></span>
It is really an <em>insurance policy</em> which
costs nothing&mdash;<em>pays</em> a premium each year
instead of <em>calling for</em> one and renders it
possible to change the entire personnel of a
business without disturbing its prosperity.</p>

<p>Advertising renders the <em>business</em> stronger
than the <em>man</em>&mdash;independent of his presence.
It permanentizes systems of merchandising,
the track of which is left for others to follow.</p>

<p>A business which is <em>not</em> advertised <em>must</em>
rely upon the <em>personality</em> of its proprietor,
and personality in business is a decreasing
factor. The public <em>does not want to know
the man</em> who owns the store&mdash;it isn't interested
in <em>him</em> but in his goods. When an unadvertised
business is sold it is only worth as
much as its <em>stock of goods and its fixtures</em>.
There is no good will to be paid for&mdash;<em>it does
not exist</em>&mdash;it has <em>not</em> been <em>created</em>. The name
over the door <em>means nothing</em> except to the
limited stream of people from the immediate
neighborhood, any of whom could tell
you <em>more</em> about some store ten miles away
which has regularly delivered its shop news
to their breakfast table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29">29&ndash;30</a></span>
It is as <em>shortsighted</em> for a man to build a
business which <em>dies with his death</em> or ceases
with his inaction, as it <em>is unfair</em> for him not
to provide for the <em>continuance of its income
to his family</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising is full of opportunities for
men who are <em>first</em> on the ground.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of advertising passes
waiting for some one to occupy them. The
first man who realizes that his line will be

He can gain an advantage over
his competitors that they can never possess.

<p>Whatever men sell, whether it is actual

Not one half of the businesses which <em>should</em>
be exploited are appearing in the newspapers.
<em>Trade grows as reputation grows
and advertising spreads reputation.</em></p>

<p>If you are engaged in a line which is
waiting for an advertising pioneer, realize
what a wonderful chance you have of being
the first of your kind to appeal directly to
the public. You stand a better chance of
leadership than those who have handicapped
their strength, by permitting you to <em>get on

You gain a prestige that those who <em>follow</em>
you, must spend more money to <em>counteract</em>.</p>

<p>If your particular line is <em>similar</em> to some
other trade or business which has <em>already</em>

up to you to start in <em>right now</em> and join your

<p class="second-heading">The Perambulating
Showcase</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">The</span> newspaper is a <em>huge</em> shop window,
carried about the city and delivered
daily into hundreds of thousands
of homes, to be examined at the leisure of
the reader. This shop window is unlike the
actual plate glass showcase only in <em>one</em>
respect&mdash;it makes display of <em>descriptions</em>
instead of <em>articles</em>.</p>

<p>You have often been impressed by the
difference between the decorations of two
window-trimmers, each of whom employed
the same materials for his work. The one
drew your attention and held it by the grace
and cleverness and art manifested in his
display. The other realized so little of the
possibilities in the materials placed at his
disposal, that unless some one called your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40">40</a></span>attention to his mediocrities you would
have gone on unconscious of their existence.</p>

<p>An advertiser must know that he gets
his results in accordance with the <em>skill</em> exercised
in preparing his verbal displays.
He must make people <em>stop</em> and pause. <em>His
copy has to stand out.</em></p>

<p>He must not only make a show of things
that are attractive to the eye but are
attractive to the people's needs, as well.</p>

<p>The window-trimmer must not make the
mistake of thinking that the showiest stocks
are the most salable. The advertiser must
not make the mistake of thinking that the
showiest words are the most clinching.</p>

<p>Windows are too few in number to be
used with indiscretion. The good merchant
puts those goods back of his plate glass
which nine people out of ten will want, once
they have seen them.</p>

<p>The good advertiser tells about goods
which nine readers out of ten will buy, if
they can be convinced.</p>

<p>Newspaper space itself is only the window,
just as the showcase is but a frame
for merchandise pictures. A window on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41">41&ndash;42</a></span>crowded street, in the best neighborhood,
where prosperous persons pass continually,
is more desirable, than one in a cheap,
sparsely settled neighborhood. An advertisement
in a newspaper with the most
readers and the most <em>prosperous</em> ones, possesses
a great advantage over the same copy,
in a medium circulating among persons who
possess less means. It would be foolish for
a shop to build its windows in an alley-way&mdash;and
just as much so to put its
advertising into newspapers which are
distributed among &ldquo;alley-dwellers.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Alexander</span> the Great was being
shown the Gordian Knot. &ldquo;It
can't be untied,&rdquo; they told him;
&ldquo;every man who tried to do so, failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexander was not discouraged because
the <em>rest</em> had flunked. He simply
realized that he would have to go at it in
a <em>different</em> way. And instead of wasting
time with his <em>fingers</em>, he drew his sword and
<em>slashed</em> it apart.</p>

<p>Every day a great business general is
shown some knot which has proven too
much for his competitors, and he succeeds,
because he finds a way to <em>cut</em> it. The
fumbler has no show so long as there is a
brother merchant who doesn't waste time
trying to accomplish the impossible&mdash;who
takes lessons from the <em>failures</em> about him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46">46</a></span>and avoids the methods which were their
downfall.</p>

<p>The knottiest problems in trade are:</p>

<ul>
<li>1&mdash;The problem of location.</li>

<li>2&mdash;The problem of getting the crowds.</li>

<li>3&mdash;The problem of keeping the crowds.</li>

<li>4&mdash;The problem of minimizing fixed
expenses.</li>

<li>5&mdash;The problem of creating a valuable
good will.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these knots is going to be untied
by fumbling fingers. They are too complicated.
They're all inextricably involved&mdash;so
twisted and entangled that they can't
be solved singly&mdash;like the Gordian knot
<em>they must be cut through at one stroke</em>. And
you can't cut the knot with anything but
advertising&mdash;because:</p>


<ul>
<li>1&mdash;A store that is constantly before the
people makes its own neighborhood.</li>

<li>2&mdash;Crowds can be brought from anywhere
by daily advertising.</li>

<li>3&mdash;Customers can always be held by
inducements.</li>

<li>4&mdash;Fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47">47</a></span> expenses can only be reduced
by increasing the volume of sales.</li>

<li>5&mdash;Good will can only be created through
publicity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advertising is breeding new giants every
year and making them more powerful every
hour. Publicity is the sustaining food of a
<em>powerful</em> store and the only strengthening
nourishment for a <em>weak</em> one. The retailer
who delays his entry into advertising must
pay the penalty of his procrastination by
facing more giant competitors as each
month of opportunity slips by.</p>

<p>Personal ability as a close purchaser and
as a clever seller, doesn't count for a hang,
so long as other men are equally well posted
and wear the sword of publicity to boot.
They are able to tie your business into constantly
closer knots, while you cannot
retaliate, because there is no knot which
their advertising cannot cut for them.</p>

<p>Yesterday you lost a customer&mdash;today
they took one&mdash;tomorrow they'll get
another. You cannot cope with their competition
because you haven't the weapon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48">48</a></span>with which to oppose it. You can't untie
your Gordian knot because it can't be
<em>untied</em>&mdash;you've got to <em>cut</em> it.</p>

<p>You must become an advertiser or you
must pay the penalty of incompetence.</p>

<p>You not only require the newspaper to
fight for a more <em>hopeful tomorrow</em>, but
to keep <em>today's</em> situation from becoming
<em>hopeless</em>.</p>

<p>This is the day when the <em>best</em> man wins&mdash;after

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Half</span> a century ago there were ten
million acres of land, within a
thousand miles of Chicago, upon
which not even a blade of grass would grow.
Today upon these very deserts are wonderful
orchards and tremendous wheatfields.
<em>The soil itself was full of possibilities. What
the land needed was water.</em> In time there
came farmers who knew that they could not
expect the streams <em>to come to them</em>, and so
they dug ditches and <em>led the water to their
properties</em> from the surrounding rivers and
lakes; they tilled the earth with their <em>brains</em>
as well as their <em>plows</em>&mdash;they became rich
through <em>irrigation</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising has made thousands of men
rich, just because they recognized the possibilities
of utilizing the newspapers to bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58">58</a></span>streams of buyers into neighborhoods that
could be made busy locations by irrigation&mdash;<em>by
drawing people from other sections</em>.</p>

<p>The successful retailer is the man who
keeps the stream of purchasers coming his
way. It isn't the <em>spot itself</em> that makes
the <em>store</em> pay&mdash;it's the <em>man</em> who makes the
<em>spot</em> pay. Centers of trade are not selected
by the public&mdash;they are created by the
force which <em>controls</em> the public&mdash;the newspapers.</p>

<p>New neighborhoods for business are being
constantly built up by men who have
located themselves in streets which they
have changed from deserted by-ways into
teeming, jostling thoroughfares, through
advertising irrigation.</p>

<p>The storekeeper who whines that his
neighborhood holds him back is squinting
at the truth&mdash;<em>he is hurting the neighborhood</em>.</p>

<p>If it lacks streams of buyers, he can
easily enough secure them by reaching out
through the columns of the daily and inducing
people from <em>other</em> sections to come
to him. Every time he influences a customer
of a competitor he is not only irrigating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59">59&ndash;60</a></span>his <em>own</em> field but is diverting the
streams upon which a <em>non-advertising</em> merchant
depends for existence. Men and
women who live next door to a shop that
does not plead for their custom will eventually
be drawn to an establishment <em>miles</em>
away because they have been made to
believe in some advantage to be gained
thereby.</p>

<p>The circulation of <em>every</em> daily is nothing
less than a <em>reservoir</em> of buyers, from which
shoppers stream in the direction that promises
the <em>most value</em> for the <em>least money</em>.</p>

<p>The magic development of the desert
lands, has its parallel in merchandising of
men who consider the newspaper an irrigating
power which can make <em>two</em> customers
grow where <em>one</em> grew before.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">If</span> a man lambasted you on the eye and
walked away and waited a week before
he repeated the performance, he
wouldn't hurt you very badly. Between
attacks you would have an opportunity to
recover from the effect of the first blow.</p>

<p>But if he smashed you and <em>kept mauling</em>,
each impact of his fist would find you less
able to stand the hammering, and a half-dozen
jabs would probably <em>knock you down</em>.</p>

<p>Now advertising is, after all, a matter of
<em>hitting the eye of the public</em>. If you allow too
great an interval to elapse between insertions
of copy the effect of the first advertisement
will have worn <em>away</em> by the
time you hit again. You may continue
your scattered talks over a stretch of years,
but you will not derive the same benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64">64</a></span>that would result from a greater concentration.
In other words, by appearing in print
<em>every</em> day, you are able to get the benefit
of the impression created <em>the day
before</em>, and as each piece of copy makes its
appearance, the result of your publicity on
the reader's mind is more pronounced&mdash;you
<ins title="musn't">mustn't</ins> stop short of a <em>knock-down
impression</em>.</p>

<p><em>Persistence is</em> the foundation of advertising
success. Regularity of insertion is <em>just
as important</em> as clever phrasing. The man
who <em>hangs on</em> is the man who <em>wins out</em>.
Cato the Elder is an example to every
merchant who <em>uses</em> the newspapers and
should be an inspiration to every storekeeper
who does <em>not</em>. For twenty years he
arose daily in the Roman senate and cried
out for the destruction of Carthage. In the
beginning he found his conferees very unresponsive.
But he <em>kept on</em> every day,
month after month and year after year,
sinking into the minds of all the necessity
of destroying Carthage, until he set all the
senate thinking upon the subject and <em>in the
end</em> Rome sent an army across the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65">65&ndash;66</a></span>and ended the reign of the Hannibals
and Hamilcars over northern Africa. <em>The
persistent utterances of a single man did it.</em></p>

<p>The history of every mercantile success
is <em>parallel</em>. The advertiser who does not let
a day slip by without having his say, is
bound to be heard and have his influence
felt. Every insertion of copy brings stronger
returns, because it has the benefit of
what has been said <em>before</em>, until the public's
attention is like an eye that has been
so repeatedly struck, that the <em>least touch</em>
of suggestion will feel like a blow.</p>

<p><em>Indefinite talk wastes</em> space. It is not
100% productive. The copy that omits
prices sacrifices half its pulling power&mdash;it
has a tendency to bring <em>lookers</em> instead
of <em>buyers</em>. It often creates false impressions.
Some people are bound to conceive the idea
that the goods are <em>higher priced</em> than in
<em>reality</em>&mdash;others, by the same token, are
just as likely to infer that the prices are
<em>lower</em> and go away thinking that you have
exaggerated your statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72">72</a></span>The reader must be <em>searched out</em> by the
copy. Big space is cheapest because it
<em>doesn't waste a single eye</em>. Publicity must
be on the <em>offensive</em>. There are far too many
advertisers who keep their lights on top <em>of</em>
their bushel&mdash;the average citizen <em>hasn't
time</em> to overturn your bushel.</p>

<p>Small space is expensive. Like a <em>one-flake
snowstorm</em>, there is not enough of it
to lay.</p>

<p>Space is a <em>comparative matter</em> after all.
It is not a case of <em>how much</em> is used as <em>how
it is used</em>. The passengers on the limited
express may realize that Jones has tacked
a twelve-inch shingle on every post and
fence for a stretch of five miles, but they
are <em>going too fast</em> to make out what the
shingles say, yet the two feet letters of
Brown's big bulletin board on top of the
hill leap at them before they have a chance
to dodge it. And at that it doesn't cost
nearly so much as the <em>sum total</em> of Jones'
dinky display.</p>

<p>Just so advertisements attractively displayed

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">An</span> advertiser must realize that there
is a vast difference between <em>amusing</em>
people and <em>convincing</em> them.
It does not pay to be &ldquo;smart&rdquo; at the line
rate of the average first class daily. I suppose
that I could draw the attention of
everybody on the street by painting half
of my face red and donning a suit of motley.
I might have a sincere purpose in wishing
<em>to attract</em> the crowd, but I would be deluding
myself if I mistook the nature of their
attention.</p>

<p>The new advertiser is especially prone to
misjudge between amusing and convincing
copy. A humorous picture <em>may</em> catch the
eyes of <em>every</em> reader, but it won't pay as
well as an illustration of <em>some piece of merchandise</em>
which will strike the eye of every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78">78</a></span><em>buyer</em>. Merchants secure varying results
from the same advertising space. The
publisher delivers to each <em>the same quality of
readers</em>, but the advertiser who plants
<em>flippancy</em> in the minds of the community
won't attain the benefit that is secured
by the merchant who imprints <em>clinching</em>
arguments there.</p>

<p>Always remember that the advertising
sections of newspapers are no different
than farming lands. And it is as preposterous
to hold the publisher responsible for
the outcome of unintelligent copy as it
would be unjust to blame the soil for bad
seed and poor culture. <em>Every advertiser
gets exactly the same number of readers from
a publisher and the same readers</em>&mdash;after
that it's up to him&mdash;the results fluctuate
in accordance with the intelligence and the
pulling power of the <em>copy</em> which is inserted.</p>

Are <em>you</em> hitting or just <em>wasting</em> shells?</p>

<p><em>Don't</em> forget that the man who writes

<p>When you stop to reflect what your

<p><em>Don't</em> tolerate an ambition on your ad-man's

<p>People read his advertising to discover
what your buyers have just brought from
the market and what you are asking for
&ldquo;O.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;T.&rdquo; They buy the <em>newspaper</em> for
information and recreation and are satisfied
with the degree of poetry and persiflage
dished up in its <em>reading</em> columns.</p>

<p><em>Don't exaggerate.</em> Poetic licenses are not
valid in business prose. The American
people <em>don't</em> want to be humbugged and the
merchant who figures upon too many fools,
finds <em>himself</em> looking into a mirror, usually
about a half hour after the sheriff has come
to look over the premises.</p>

<p><em>Don't imitate.</em> Advertising is a <em>special
measure</em> garment. Businesses are not built
in <em>ready-made</em> sizes. Copy which fits somebody
else's selling plans, won't fit your store
without sagging at the chest or riding up at
the collar. Duplicated <em>argument</em> and duplicated
<em>results</em> are not twins. Your policy of
publicity must be <em>specially</em> measured from
your policy of merchandising.</p>

<p><em>Don't put your advertising in charge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83">83&ndash;84</a></span>an amateur.</em> Let somebody else stand the
expense of his educational blunders. Remember
you are making a plea before the
bar of public confidence. Your ad-writer
is an advocate. <em>Like a bad lawyer, he can
lose a good case by not making the most of
the facts at hand.</em></p>

<p><em>Don't get the &ldquo;sales&rdquo; habit.</em> &ldquo;Sales&rdquo; are
stimulants. When held too often their effect
is <em>weakening</em>. The merchant who continually
yells &ldquo;<em>bargain</em>&rdquo; is like the old hen
who was always crying &ldquo;fox.&rdquo; When the

stopped. The Chinese judge a medical man
not by the number of years <em>he</em> lives, but by
the length of time his patrons survive.</p>

<p>An advertising medium must be judged
in the same way. The fact that it has <em>age</em>
to its credit isn't so important as the <em>age
of its advertising patronage</em>. Whenever a
daily continues to display the store talk of
the same establishment year after year, it's
a pretty sure sign that the merchant has
<em>made money</em> out of that newspaper, because
no publication can continue to be a losing
investment to its customers over a stretch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88">88</a></span>of time, without the fact being discovered.
And when a newspaper is not only able to
boast of an honor roll of stores that have
continued to appear in its pages for a
stretch of decades, but at the same time
demonstrates that it carries <em>more</em> business
than its competitors, it has <em>proven its superiority</em>
as plainly as a mountain peak
which rises above its fellows.</p>

<p>The combination of <em>stability and progress</em>
is the strongest virtue that a newspaper
can possess. <em>Only the fit survive</em>&mdash;reputation
is a <em>difficult</em> thing to <em>get</em> and a harder
thing to <em>hold</em>&mdash;it takes <em>merit</em> to <em>earn</em> it and
<em>character</em> to <em>maintain</em> it. There is a vast
difference between <em>fame</em> and <em>notoriety</em>, and
just as much difference between a <em>famous
newspaper</em> and a <em>notorious one</em>.</p>

<p>Just as a manufacturer is always eager
to install his choicest stocks in a store which
has earned the respect of the community,
just so a retailer should be anxious to insert
his name in a newspaper which has <em>earned
the respect of its readers</em>. The manufacturer
feels that he will receive a square deal from
a store which has age to its credit. He can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89">89&ndash;90</a></span>expect as much from a newspaper which is
a credit to its age!</p>

<p>The newspaper which outlives the rest
does so because it was <em>best fitted to</em>&mdash;it
had to <em>earn</em> the confidence of its readers&mdash;and
<em>keep it</em>. It had to be a <em>better</em> newspaper
than any other and <em>better</em> newspapers go to
the homes of <em>better</em> buyers. Every bit of
its circulation has the element of <em>quality
and staying power</em>. And it is the <em>respectable</em>,
<em>home-loving</em> element of every community&mdash;not
the touts and the gamblers&mdash;toward
which the merchant must look for his business
<em>vertebrae</em>&mdash;he cannot find buyers unless
he uses the <em>newspaper</em> that enters their
homes. And when <em>he does</em> enter their
homes he must not confuse the sheet that
comes in the back gate with the newspaper
that is delivered at the front door.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">A moving</span> van came rolling down

Percheron was <em>doing all the work</em>, and it
seemed that he would have got along far
better in single harness, than he managed
with his inferior mates <em>retarding</em> his
speed.</p>

<p>The advertiser who selects a group of
newspapers usually harnesses two <em>lame</em>
propositions to every <em>pulling</em> newspaper
on his list, and just as the van driver probably
dealt out an <em>equal</em> portion of feed to
each of his animals, just so many a merchant
is paying practically the same rate to a
<em>weak</em> daily, that he is allowing the <em>sturdy
profitable sheet</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94">94</a></span>
Unfortunately the accepted custom of
inserting the <em>same</em> advertisement in <em>every</em>
paper acts to the distinct disadvantage of
the <em>meritorious</em> medium. The advertiser
charges the sum total of his <em>expense</em> against
the sum total of his <em>returns</em>, and thereby
does <em>himself and the best puller an injustice</em>,
by crediting the less productive sheets
with results that they have <em>not</em> earned.</p>

<p>It's the <em>pulling power</em> of the newspaper
as well as the horse that proves its value,
and if advertisers were as level headed as
they should be, they would take the trouble
to put every daily in which they advertise
<em>on trial</em> for at least a month and advertise
a different department or article in each,
carefully tabulating the returns. If this
were done, fifty per cent of the advertising
now carried in weaker newspapers would be
withdrawn and the patronage of the stronger
sheets would <em>advance</em> in that proportion.</p>

<p><em>There are newspapers in many a city that
are, single handed, able to build up businesses.</em>
Their circulation is solid muscle
and sinew&mdash;<em>all pull</em>. It isn't the number
of copies <em>printed</em> but the number of copies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95">95&ndash;96</a></span>that reach the hands of buyers&mdash;it isn't
the number of <em>readers</em> but the number of
readers with <em>money</em> to spend&mdash;it isn't the
<em>bulk</em> of a circulation but the amount of the
circulation which is <em>available</em> to the advertiser&mdash;it
isn't <em>fat</em> but <em>brawn</em>&mdash;that tell
in the long run.</p>

<p>There are certain earmarks that indicate
these strengths and weaknesses. They are
as plain to the observing eye as the signs
of the woods are significant to the trapper.
The <em>news</em> columns tell you what you can
expect out of the <em>advertising</em> columns. A
newspaper <em>always finds</em> the class of readers
to which it is <em>edited</em>. When its mental tone
is <em>low</em> and its moral tone is <em>careless</em> depend
upon it&mdash;<em>the readers match the medium</em>.</p>

<p>No gun can hit a target <em>outside</em> of its
range. No newspaper can aim its policy
in <em>one</em> direction and score in <em>another</em>. No
advertiser can find a different class of men
and women than the publisher has found for
himself. He is judged by the company
he keeps. <em>If he lies down with dogs he will
arise with fleas.</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">A coal</span> cart stopped before an office
building in Washington and the
driver dismounted, removed the
cover from a manhole, ran out his chute,
and proceeded to empty the load. An old
negro strolled over and stood watching
him. Suddenly the black man glanced
down and immediately burst into a fit of
uncontrollable laughter, which continued
for several minutes. The cart driver looked
at him in amusement. &ldquo;Say, Uncle,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;do you always laugh when you

The advertiser who displays lack of
judgment in selecting the newspapers which
carry his copy often confuses the <em>sewer</em> and
the <em>cellar</em>.</p>

<p>All the money that is put <em>into</em> newspapers
isn't taken <em>out</em> again, by any means. The
fact that all dailies possess a certain physical
likeness, doesn't necessarily signify a
similarity in character, and it's <em>character</em>
in a newspaper that brings returns. The
editor who conducts a journalistic sewer,
finds a <em>different</em> class of readers than the
publisher who respects himself enough to
respect his readers.</p>

<p>What goes into a newspaper largely determines
the class of homes into which the
newspaper goes. An irresponsible, scandal-mongering,
muck-raking sheet is certainly
not supported by the buying classes of
people. It <em>may be</em> perused by thousands
of readers, but such readers are seldom
purchasers of advertised goods.</p>

<p>It's the clean-cut, steady, normal-minded
citizens who form the bone and sinew and
muscle of the community. It's the sane,
self-respecting, <em>dependable</em> newspaper that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101">101</a></span>enters their homes and it's the <em>home</em> sale
that indicates the strength of an advertising
medium.</p>

<p>No clean-minded father of a family wishes
to have his wife and children brought in
contact with the most maudlin and banal
phases of life. He defends them from the
sensational editor and the unpleasant advertiser.
He subscribes to <em>a newspaper which
he does not fear to leave about the house</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the respectable newspaper can
always be counted upon to produce more
sales than one which may even own a larger
<em>circulation</em> but whose distribution is in ten
editions among unprofitable citizens.</p>

<p>You can no more expect to sell goods to
people who <em>haven't money</em>, than you can hope
<em>to pluck oysters from rose-bushes</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't the number of readers <em>reached</em>, but
the number of readers whose <em>purses</em> can be
reached, that constitutes the value of circulation.
It's one thing to arouse <em>their
attention</em>, but it's a far different thing to
get <em>their money</em>. <em>The mind may be willing,
but the pocketbook may be weak.</em></p>

<p>If you had the choice of a thousand acres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>of desert land or a hundred acres of oasis,
you'd select the fertile spot, realizing that
the larger tract had less value because it
would be less productive.</p>

<p>The advertiser who really understands
how he is spending his money, takes care
that he is not pouring his money into
<em>deserts and sewers</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Circulation</span> is a commodity which
must be bought with the same common
sense used in selecting potatoes,
cloth and real estate. <em>It can be measured

She does not calculate the number of vegetables

a piece of cloth she first makes sure that it

When you buy a piece of property you consider

Just so when you buy <em>advertising</em> you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106">106</a></span>must find out how much of the circulation

the same thoughtfulness that you devoted
to selecting the spot where your goods are
sold.</p>

<p>A dealer in precious stones would be
foolish to open up in a tenement district,
and equally short-sighted, to tell about his
jewelry in a newspaper largely distributed
there. Out of ten thousand men and
women who might <em>see</em> what he had to say
not ten of them could <em>afford to buy his goods</em>.
These ten thousand readers would be mass
without muscle. He could make them
<em>willing</em> to do business with him, but <em>their
incomes wouldn't let them become customers</em>.</p>

<p>One of the greatest mistakes in publicity
is <em>to drop your lines where the fish can't
take your bait</em>.</p>

<p>Circulation is, as you see, a very interesting
subject, but very few people know anything
about it. It would surprise you to
know that this ignorance often extends to
the business offices of newspapers. I have
known publishers to continually mistake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107">107&ndash;108</a></span>the <em>class of</em> their readers and have met hundreds
of them who had the most fantastic
ideas upon the figures of their circulation.</p>

<p>While I would not be so harsh as to
accuse them of anything more than being
<em>mistaken</em>, none the less their tendency to
infect <em>others</em> with this misinformation
renders it extremely advisable for <em>you to</em>
become a member of the Missouri society&mdash;and
&ldquo;<em>be shown</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don't rely solely on circulation statements.
You don't understand the tricks
in their making. Make the newspaper
which carries your advertisement show you
the list of its advertisers. A newspaper
which prints the most advertising, month
after month, year after year, is always the
best medium. This is equally true in New
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Kenosha and
Walla Walla.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of soap who has his
goods on sale from Oskaloosa to Timbuctoo
doesn't care <em>how widely</em> a newspaper circulation
is scattered. Whoever reads about his
product is near to <em>some</em> store or other where
it is sold&mdash;but you have just <em>one</em> store.</p>

<p>Buying advertising circulation is very
much like ordering a steak&mdash;if the waiter
brings you a porter-house twice as big as
your <em>digestion</em> can handle, you've paid
twice as much as the steak was worth to
<em>you</em>, even if it <em>is</em> worth the price to the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112">112</a></span>
You derive your profit not from the circulation
that your <em>advertisement</em> gets, but
from circulation <em>that gets people to buy</em>.</p>

<p>If two newspapers offer you their columns
and one shows a distribution almost entirely
within the city and in towns that
rely upon your city for buying facilities,
your business can digest all of its influence.
If the other has <em>as much circulation</em>, but
only <em>one third</em> of it is in <em>local territory</em>, mere
bulk cannot establish its value to <em>you</em>&mdash;<em>it's

of its influence which is concentrated where
men and women can't get your <em>goods</em> after
you get their <em>attention</em>, is <em>sheer waste</em>.</p>

<p>By dividing the number of copies he
prints into his line rate, a publisher may
fallaciously demonstrate to you that his
space is sold as low as that of his stronger
competitors, but if half his circulation is
too <em>far away to bring buyers</em>, his real <em>rate</em>
is double what it seems. He is like the
butcher who weighs in all the bone and sinew

number of <em>advertising responses</em>.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a circulation
which strikes the <em>same</em> reader several times
in the <em>same</em> day and the circulation which
does <em>not</em> repeat the individual. There is a
difference between circulation which is concentrated
into an area from which every
reader can be expected to come to your
establishment, if you can <em>interest</em> him, and a
circulation that spreads over half a dozen
states and shows its greatest volume in
territory so far from your establishment
that you can't get a buyer out of ten
thousand readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116">116</a></span>
You've got to weigh and measure all
these things when you weigh and measure
circulation figures. It isn't the number of
copies <em>printed</em>, but the number of copies
<em>sold</em>&mdash;not the number of papers <em>distributed</em>,
but the number of papers distributed in
<em>responsive</em> territory&mdash;not the number of
readers <em>reached</em>, but the number of readers
who have the price to <em>buy</em> what you want
to <em>sell</em>&mdash;that determine the value of
circulation to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 120px;">You can take a single egg and whip it
into an omelette soufflé which <em>seems</em> to be a
<em>whole plateful</em>, but the extra bulk is just
<em>hot air</em> and <em>sugar</em>&mdash;the change in form has
not increased the amount of egg <em>substance</em>
and it's the <em>substance</em> in circulation, just as
it is the <em>nutrition</em> in the egg, that <em>counts</em>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
